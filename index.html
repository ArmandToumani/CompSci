    <p>9/16/2022 - This week we worked and made alot of progression
    on our rube goldberg machine. On friday we had a fun time building a paper 
    boat wiht notheng else than a single sheet of paper. hen we added weight,
    our group added 90 grams of weight. IN the end it was a lot of weight but
    it stayed afloat for 5 minutes. We won this battle with another boat but 
    the two others sank. This was a fun week of engineering.</p>
