    <p>9/2/2022 - This week we started to use tinker cad.
    We started to explore how to use it with our free time.
    On friday we had a challenge to build and design a household object, 
    I chose a frige.</p>
    
    <p>9/16/2022 - This week we worked and made alot of progression
    on our rube goldberg machine. On friday we had a fun time building a paper 
    boat wiht notheng else than a single sheet of paper. hen we added weight,
    our group added 90 grams of weight. In the end it was a lot of weight but
    it stayed afloat for 5 minutes. We won this battle with another boat but 
    the two others sank. This was a fun week of engineering.</p>
    
    <p>9/23/22 - This week we finished and tested our groups rube godlberg 
    machines. Or Rube Goldberg machine had a slope, a trap door, a pulley, 
    and a see saw with a needle at the end that pops the baloon. Our group 
    one of the most complex machines out of our class. Over all this week
    was one of the best ones yet becasue we got to improve our machines then
    test them.</p>
